## 🧠 Features

- 🔍 **HSV-based segmentation** to isolate pests from the background
- ⚙️ **Morphological post-processing** to refine segmented areas
- 🧵 **Texture analysis** using Gabor filters and **GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix)**
- 🎨 **Color histogram** analysis for color-based features
- 🌲 **Random Forest Classifier** for pest image classification
- 🧪 **Test dataset** supported for inference and prediction
- 💾 Saves segmented, cleaned, and Gabor-filtered images in class-specific folders
